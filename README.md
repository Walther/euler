Walther's Project Euler repository

[Project Euler](https://static.projecteuler.net/) is a website containing hundreds of computing / programming problems centered around mathematics.

This repository contains my solutions to some of those problems, written in Haskell.
In many cases I've created generic functions that can be used with other parameters as well - however, the `main` functions always include the parameters specified in the problem.

This means you can:

1. execute any of the problems by running `runhaskell problem`
2. open up a `ghci`, `:load problem`, and try the functions with different parameters,
3. look at the implementations and potentially use the functions elsewhere

Please remember: solving Project Euler tasks is more about learning than the score of completed exercises. Do yourself a favour and don't cheat :)
