Walther's Project Euler repository

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a website containing hundreds of computing / programming problems centered around mathematics.

This repository contains my solutions to some of those problems, written in Haskell; however, in many cases I've tried to not only solve the specific case, but to build a more generic function that can be used with other parameter values as well.

Feel free to take some ideas from here, but remember: solving Project Euler tasks is more about learning than about the score on your badge -> don't cheat and just copypaste ;)
